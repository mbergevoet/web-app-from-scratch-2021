# Project description

For this course I'm using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) to make a webapp from scratch with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The end result is a modular, single page web app (SPA). Data will be retrieved from an external API of your choice, manipulated and finally shown in the UI of the App. You will learn different ways to structure code and develop your own coding style. With the gained knowledge you will be able to build interactive prototypes, based on real data. Also you will gain a better understanding of how API's, frameworks and libraries work.

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features 🤔 -->

# Features

My idea currently for this project is to have a Star Wars encyclopedia which lists plantes and characters per episode or movie. The overview page will have my favorite episodes in there and picking one will take you to a detail page with all the planets, characters and vehicles used in that episode. There will also be an option to translate a page into Wookie language. This isn't very usefull but the API offers this feature so I might as well use it for some extra functionality.

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->

# Checklist

-   Fetch data from the API
-   Style a main page
-   Inject data into HTML
-   Style a detail page
-   Add Wookie translate option
